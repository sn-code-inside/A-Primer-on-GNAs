# A_Primer_on_Generative_Adversarial_Networks
This repository contains the codes in the book entitled A Primer on Generative Adversarial Networks
It containes multiple .ipynb file. Each file corresponds to the code implementation or data preparation
and preprocessing for specific GAN application

You can easily download the file you want and test it on your own machine.
Before testing any file make sure all modules are installed on your local machine and it has the minimum requirements
